Simple script to fetch, patch and build python for the iPhone and
iPhone Simulator

The final products are located in `Python-2.6.5/_install/'

the most interesting files for iPhone development being
 * include/
 * lib/libpython2.6.a
 * lib/python2.6/python26.zip

To compile with Xcode, add libpython2.6.a to your project and create a
directory `lib' in your resources folder containing `python26.zip'.
You will also need to add `include' to your header search path

Known bug:
 * spaces cannot be present in path (most likely an issue with the Python Makefile
